Title: A Bayesian Approach for Clustering Constant-wise Change-point Data
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Ana Carolina da Cruz
Maintainer: The package maintainer <adacruz@uwo.ca>
Description: BayesCPclust aims to estimate the change points in constant-wise data sequences 
    while performing clustering simultaneously. 
    A Gibbs sampler algorithm was developed to estimate the number of clusters,
    cluster assignments, number of change points, their positions, and constant levels.
